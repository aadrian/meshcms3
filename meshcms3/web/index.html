<p>Welcome to MeshCMS. This is a sample home page that you can easily edit after
you have logged in.</p>

<p>Here is a list of tasks you can try to test this CMS:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>click on <em>Login</em> and insert username
  <em><strong>admin</strong></em> and password
  <em><strong>admin</strong></em>;</p> </li>

  <li><p>when you see the <em>Control Panel</em>,
  click on <em>Site Home</em> to go back to this page, then click on <em>Edit
  this page</em> to open the WYSIWYG editor;</p> </li>

  <li><p>experiment with the
  editor and then save the page;</p> </li>

  <li><p>go to <em>Manage Pages</em> in the
  <em>Control Panel</em> and create a new page under the home page, then edit
  it;</p> </li>

  <li><p>go back to <em>Manage Pages</em> and try
  changing themes (pages whose theme field is empty will inherit the theme from
  the parent)</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>You need to allow popups from the site where
MeshCMS is running, otherwise you won&#39;t be able to use the file browser to
choose links and images while editing pages.</p> <p>Note: all themes except
<strong>Flowers</strong> are rough adaptations of GPL Mambo themes downloaded
from <a href="http://www.mambohut.com/">Mambo Hut</a>.</p>
